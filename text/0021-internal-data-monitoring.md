# [Watchdog]

`Watchdog` is a monorepo that will contain a variety of Creative Labs data analysis tools for internal use. 

## Blurb

The goal of this project is to allow all the teams across Creative Labs board to make data-driven decisions. We want to set up a system where all members can access previous data and use insights from the past to make good judgement calls in the present.

Watchdog is meant to be a monorepo to house various data analysis tools for Creative Labs. There are two main projects to implement currently. The first is a continuation of the current Watchdog project, which is a tool to get data analytics on Creative Labs projects. Currently, it fetches project application information and displays its various statistics. An improvement upon this would be to showcase the findings in an improved way - through new formats such as heatmaps or even allowing the user to choose their own method of display (bar graph, pie chart, etc). Another improvement upon the original Watchdog project would be to allow board members to better access the data - especially the visualization.

The second project would be a program that monitors how others interact with Creative Labs. This would include where (and at what frequency) users are navigating towards on our main website or understanding the correlation between social media posts interactions (ads, likes, shares) and event attendance.

This project is primarily meant for Creative Labs board members but we could look at displaying some of the data publicly through a blog post for marketing content!

### Future Goals
The obvious first direction for future goals after these two projects is for new data analysis projects to add and implement into this monorepo. It would be beneficial for there to be a system in place where anyone on Creative Labs board can submit an issue in regards to CL data - whether it's displaying a certain dataset or exploring if there is a correlation between two factors.

## Why are we doing this?

Event attendance and participation is frequently stressed within internal board, and it would be great to see how we can collectively improve those numbers and grow our organization! Watchdog allows us to benefit from years of past datasets that can help us make informed decisions in the future. This would be especially great for design and marketing teams so that they can focus on strategies that have been proven to work.

## What are the requirements for this project?

> How many people would we need for this project? Do we need to utilize OCI?
> Listing the technical requirements ahead of time will make it easier to find
> team members with experience **and** be transparent to people who want to learn.

## What are we launching today?

> Ideas are cheap, execution is not. What exactly can we see in the near future?
> What are the barebones requirements to officially release this project?

## FAQ

> Working backwards, what are some questions a user, developer, designer, marketer
> have regarding the project? Answering these questions ahead of time will make
> the development process smoother and better for everyone involved.
